Routing is used to naviagte from page(component) to another page (component)
Angular Routing is essential for Single Page Applications
Step 1: goto routing module and define routes to different components in routes array as follows
const routes:Routes= [
    { path:"about", component: AbcComponent }
    ]
    it means if some one goes url/about ---> AbcComponent loads on screen

step2: To clarify routing modules where to print your routed component, use following code

<router-outlet></router-outlet>

step3: to make user accessable to different router , use anchor tags with routerLink
<a routerLink="/about">click me</a>

ste4: for dynamic routing path has to be path:'something/:something'
step 5 : for notfound path has to be path:'**'
